---
Redis Enterprise Software (RS)Â includes rladmin, a command-line interface (CLI)
that you can use to do advanced administrative tasks.
Some of these tasks you can also do through the management web UI.

For example, with the rladmin CLI you can:

- View the detailed status of the cluster including information about each node, each database, and each shard
- Failover between a master and slave shard, or a master and slave endpoint
- Migrate a specific shard or endpoint between nodes
- Tune specific internal parameters of a database
- Upgrade the version of a database to the most current version supported by the cluster

## Using the rladmin CLI

To open the rladmin CLI:

1. Login to the RS host with an account that is a member of the **redislabs** OS group.

    If you are a non-root user, you must add `/opt/redislabs/bin/` to your PATH environment variables

1. Run: `rladmin`

    {{% note %}}
If the CLI does not recognize the rladmin command,
you run this command to load the needed configuration first: `bash -l`
    {{% /note %}}

## Command Syntax Help

In the rladmin CLI you can:

- Enter `?` to view the full list of available commands.
- Enter `help` followed by the name of a command for a detailed explanation of the command and its usage.
- Press the Tab key for command completion.

#### node

Usage:

    node <id> enslave [ shards_only | endpoints_only ]
    node <id> snapshot [ create | list | restore | delete ]
    node <id> remove

Updates cluster node configuration.  Nodes support a single address which
can be configured only when the node is down or offline.

Nodes support zero or more external addresses, which are used to advertise
the service and accept inbound user connections.  It is possible to
configure one or more addresses in a single 'set' command, or change the
existing configuration using 'add' or 'remove' to add additional addresses
or remove existing addresses, respectively.

Enslaving all bound resources of a node is available using the 'enslave' command.

Handling node snapshots from the current node state (active endpoints and shards)may be done using the 'snapshot create', 'snapshot restore', 'snapshot list' and'snapdshot delete' commands.

#### placement

Usage:

    placement [db <db:id | name>] [ dense | sparse ]

Configure shards placement policy for a given database.

#### restart

Usage:

    restart db <db:id | name> [preserve_roles] [discard_data] [force_discard]

Performs a restart of the Redis software in use by a specific database
instance, by scheduling a restart of the master and slave processes.

The **preserve_roles** optional flag indicates an additional fail-over
can be used in order to guarantee that the roles of masters and slaves are
preserved by the end of the upgrade process.

The **discard_data** optional flag indicates that the data can be discarded and will not be saved after restart.

The **force_discard** optional flag indicates we force discard_data even if there is replication or persistence.

#### status

Usage:

full status report:

    status [extra options] [issues_only]

status report of just the nodes table:

    status nodes [extra options] [sort <COLUMN_TITLES>] [issues_only]

status report of just the database table:

    status databases [extra options] [sort <COLUMN_TITLES>] [issues_only]

status report of just the endpoints table:

    status endpoints [node <id>] [db <db:id | name>] [extra options] [sort <COLUMN_TITLES>] [issues_only]

status report of just the shards table:

    status shards [node <id>] [db <db:id | name>] [extra options] [sort <COLUMN_TITLES>] [issues_only]

Display current cluster status and topology information.

Extra info options:

| options             | description                                                             |

| extra backups       | Shows extra dbs and shards periodic backup                              |
| extra frag          | Shows extra shards fragmented memory that could be reclaimed by restart |
| extra watchdog      | Shows extra watchdog status                                             |
| extra rack_id       | Shows rack_id even when cluster is not marked as rack aware             |
| extra redis_version | Shows redis version of all the databases                                |
| extra all           | Shows all extra info                                                    |

COLUMN_TITLES: a list of table column titles.
e.g:
    status shards sort NODE USED_MEMORY

issues_only: Filters out all the OK items from status.

#### tune

Usage:

    tune db <db:id | name> [slave_buffer <value>]
        [slave_ha <enabled/disabled>]
        [slave_ha_priority <value>]

**slave_ha** is specified as default/enabled/disabled, and allows turning
on/off the slave high availability mechanism. default takes the cluster setting.

**slave_ha_priority** is an positive integer value, that represents the priority
of the bdb in slave high availability mechanism. it overrides the calculated priority of the bdb.

**slave_ha** is specified as enabled/disabled, and allows tuning the
default for the slave high availability mechanism.
it can be overwritten per database.

**slave_ha_grace_period** specifies the time in seconds,
between when a node fails, and when slave high availability mechanism
starts relocating shards from it to another node.

**slave_ha_cooldown_period** specifies the time in seconds.
a period after shard relocation in which slave high availability mechanism
cannot relocate from any other node.

**slave_ha_bdb_cooldown_period** specifies the time in seconds.
a period after shard relocation in which slave high availability mechanism
cannot relocate database from any other node.

#### upgrade

Usage:

    upgrade db <db:id | name>
        [preserve_roles] [keep_current_version]
        [discard_data] [force_discard]

Performs an upgrade of the Redis software in use by a specific database
instance, by scheduling a restart of the master and slave processes.

The **preserve_roles** optional flag indicates an additional fail-over
can be used in order to guarantee that the roles of masters and slaves are
preserved by the end of the upgrade process.

The **keep_current_version** optional flag requests an upgrade to the new patch release,
without upgrading to the latest major.minor version.

The **discard_data** optional flag indicates that the data can be discarded and will not be saved after upgrade.

The **force_discard** optional flag indicates we force discard_data even if there is replication or persistence.
